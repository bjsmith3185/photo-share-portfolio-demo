TODO

!! client Admin.js line 409. need to move the reset password logic to server

!! why does it sign out teh user when a new user is added?




*** Change password     
    - instead of showing the users password when they reset it
        - have them enter current password
        - enter new password twice


*** Image box
    - work on image box size so it doesnt change when notes are added
    - update or remove rotate button.

*** if a picture is deleted from the app
    --- a function needs to check each users favorties [] and remove that _id reference to avoid errors when the user tries to view favorites.
    - may be able to do this by comparing _id's and if the users fav does not match a pic in the picture collection that entry is skipped.

*** maybe use images for some of the links
        - for remove pictures, a single image or three images..
