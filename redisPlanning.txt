Redis


when shold i use redis?

* check if user exists() on each page load

* get all pictures
    - the first time after login
    - on any change: fav, unfav, add note, upload pic

* get favorites


============

redis stores

user signin: redis key = user_id

view all pictures: redis key = user_id + /allPics

view fav pictures: redis key = user_id + /favPics
